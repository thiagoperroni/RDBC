Copyright  1992 - 2021 Keysight Technologies
Simulation started on: Fri Nov  5 11:32:44 2021
Simulation Mode: RF
Substrate valid
Using the minimal snap distance of 0.0004 mm
(4 layout resolution points) for layout healing.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout healing changed the layout. The actual
highest aggregate snap distance was 0.0004 mm.
Further details have been written to the DRC
report.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout is electrically large above 2.75 GHz (space wave radiation)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Substrate is electrically large above 17.4 GHz (surface wave radiation)
RF simulation can be less accurate as it ignores radiation
Consider:  - lowering the maximum frequency
           - simulating in MW mode
